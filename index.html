            <h2>📌 Featured Projects</h2>
            <h3>📊 Mindfulness, Cognitive Functioning, and Academic Achievement Analysis</h3>
            <p>Conducted an extensive data analysis using Python on a publicly available dataset from Rowan University.</p>
            <p>Investigated the relationships between mindfulness, stress, and academic performance in college students.</p>
            <p>Applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical modeling (linear & quadratic regression), mediation/moderation analysis, and K-Means clustering to uncover key insights.</p>
            <p>Utilized data visualization techniques to illustrate patterns and presented findings in a detailed report.</p>
            <p>Demonstrated strong skills in data-driven decision-making, research, and statistical analysis.</p>
        </div>

             <h3>📊 Extraction and Analysis of Multi-modal Dataset for Mental Disorder Detection</h3>
             <p>This study integrated multiple modalities to investigate neurophysiological and cognitive markers of depression.
             <p>Combined EEG recordings (resting state and an emotional dot-probe task) with behavioral performance measures and clinical questionnaires.</p>
             <p>EEG data were processed to extract features such as power spectral density, event-related potentials, and time–frequency representations.</p>
             <p>Reaction times and accuracy from cognitive tasks were analyzed alongside EEG features.</p>
             <p>Clinical assessments captured depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep quality, trauma history, and coping strategies.</p>
             <p>Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques were applied to compare individuals with Major Depressive Disorder and healthy controls.</p>
             <p>Advanced interpretability methods were used to understand feature contributions.</p>
             <p>This multi-modal, data-driven approach aims to enhance the objectivity and sensitivity of depression diagnosis.</p>
